And now
AsapSCIENCE presents 200 digits of π
To start, let's review the first one hundred
Three point one-four-one-five-nine, this is π
Followed by two-six-five-three-five-eight-nine
Circumference over diameter
Seven-nine, then three-two-three
OMG, can't you see?
Eight-four-six-two-six-four-three
And now we're on a spree
Thirty-eight and thirty-two, now we're blue
Oh, who knew?
Seven thousand, nine-hundred fifty and then a two
Eighty-eight and forty-one, so much fun
Now a run
Nine-seven-one-six-nine-three-nine-nine
Three-seven, fifty-one
Halfway done
Oh-five-eight, now don't be late
Two-oh-nine, where's the wine?
Seven-four, it's on the floor
Then nine-four-four-five-nine
Two-three-oh, we gotta go
Seven-eight, we can't wait
One-six-four-oh-six-two-eight
We're almost near the end, keep going
Sixty-two, we're getting through
Oh-eight-nine-nine, on time
Eight-six-two-eight-oh-three-four
There's only a few more
Eight-two, then five-three
Forty-two, eleven, seven-oh and sixty-seven
We're done, was that fun?
Learning random digits
So that you can brag to your friends
Are you ready for more?
Well, here's another hundred digits
Nine, eight, two, one, four (so many more)
Eight-oh-eight, six-five (let's all high five)
Thirteen, two-eight-two (we'll look at you)
Three-hundred and six (in a bag of tricks)
Six-four-seven-oh, if you go slow
Nine-thirty-eight-four, then you will score
Four-six-oh-nine-five, now let's dive
Five-oh-five into a π
Eight blue flying bats over two gold cats
Twenty-three shoes, a hundred seventy-two screws
Five well-dressed small dogs, working thirty-five hour jobs
Oh, this song is so absurd, just rhyming pure random words
Nine-four-oh-eight-one, can you taste your tongue?
Two-eight-four-eight-one, it just can't be done
One-one-seven-four-five, oh, now, close that door
Get those numbers in your brain and keep them forever more
Two-eight-four-one-oh-two, seven-oh, let's make a stew
One-nine-three-eight-five-two-one, one-oh-five-five-five-nine
Now, our final run
Six-four-four-six-two-two, nine-four-eight, look at you
Nine-five-four, nine-three-oh, three-eight-one-nine, and run
